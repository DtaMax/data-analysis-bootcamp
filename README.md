# 3-Month Data Analysis Bootcamp

---

## Overview

This repository documents my journey through a comprehensive **12-week data analysis bootcamp**. The bootcamp is designed to transform a beginner into a confident data analyst by integrating essential tools and concepts weekly, building upon foundational knowledge.

## Bootcamp Philosophy

The bootcamp emphasizes a **holistic learning experience**, focusing on the practical application and interrelation of various data analysis disciplines and and tools. Each component plays a crucial role:

* **SQL (Structured Query Language):** The cornerstone for data retrieval, management, and efficient interaction with databases. It's the primary language for extracting raw data.
* **Statistics:** Provides the fundamental scientific methods for understanding, interpreting, and drawing valid conclusions from data, moving beyond just numbers to meaningful insights.
* **Python (with Pandas):** A versatile and scalable language for advanced data manipulation, complex analysis, automation of tasks, and predictive modeling.
* **Power BI:** A leading business intelligence tool for transforming analyzed data into interactive visualizations and dashboards, effectively communicating insights to diverse audiences.
* **Excel:** Remains an essential tool for initial data exploration, quick analyses, and widespread business communication, often serving as the starting point for data interaction.
